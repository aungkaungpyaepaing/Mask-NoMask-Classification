<h1 align="center">Mask and No Mask Classifier</h1>

After watching the news about air pollution, just thought about making a Mask and No Mask Classification Model so that it can be used in different programs like Real-time detection programs in Hotel, Hospital, Classroom, Work, and so on...
This model is trained by Convolutional Neural Network and work pretty well based on the database.
