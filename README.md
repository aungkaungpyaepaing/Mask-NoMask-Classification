<h1 align="center">Mask and No Mask Classifier</h1>

After watching news about air pollution, just thought about making an Mask and No Mask Classification Model so that it can be used in different program like Real time detection program in Hotel, Hospital, Classroom, Work and so on...
This model is trained by Convolutional Neural Network and work pretty well based on the database.
